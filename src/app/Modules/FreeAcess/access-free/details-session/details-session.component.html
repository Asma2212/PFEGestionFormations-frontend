            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
              industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
              scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
              electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
              of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
              like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

              COURSE OVERVIEW

              Developing your first full stack web application with Angular and Spring Boot is fun.

              In this course, you will learn the basics of full stack web development developing a Basic Todo Management
              Application using Angular, Spring Boot, and Spring Security Frameworks. You will build the Todo Management
              Application step by step - in more than 100 steps.

              You will be using Angular (Frontend Framework), TypeScript Basics, Angular CLI(To create Angular
              projects), Spring Boot (REST API Framework), Spring (Dependency Management), Spring Security
              (Authentication and Authorization - Basic and JWT), BootStrap (Styling Pages), Maven (dependencies
              management), Node (npm), Visual Studio Code (TypeScript IDE), Eclipse (Java IDE) and Tomcat Embedded Web
              Server.

              We will help you set up each one of these.

              Angular is a complete front end framework with a wide range of features. Spring Boot is an awesome
              framework to build RESTful API and Microservices. Let's combine these frameworks and create an awesome
              full stack web application.
